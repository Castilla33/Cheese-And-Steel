# Cheese And Steel 1.16.5-V1 
This is my very first mod ever made for Minecraft!
I've always wanted to make one, since I was a kid, and now that I think I had enough Java knowledge and time to enjoy on this project, I decided to jump onto making one, and so I did!

## Content
I decided to create a mod that wasn't really hard to make for me, so I decided that this mod would need:
<ul>
  <li>Food.</li>
  <li>Ores.</li>
  <li>Wepons.</li>
  <li>Tools.</li>
  <li>Armor.</li>
  <li>Blocks.</li>
  <li>Few more items.</li>
</ul>

### Food
<ul>
<li><b>Cheese</b></li>
Cheese nourishes 2 hunger points.<br>
<b>Craft:</b> Steel lid + Milk Bucket + Both kind of mushrooms.<br>
<li><b>Sandwich</b></li>
The Sandwich nourishes 12 hunger points.<br>
<b>Craft:</b> Cheese + Cooked Chicken + Bread + Any kind of leaves.<br>
</ul>

### Steel
Steel can be found in caves, as Steel Ore!
Once the ore is melted or blasted, it will give the player steel ingot.<br>
With this steel ingot, the player can craft Weapons as sword and Armor as they are usually crafted in the game.<br>
These weapons and tools are powerful, but they are really fragile, so be careful!<br><br>
Player will also be able to craft the steel lid, with the following pattern:
<hr>
010<br>
101<br>
<sup>(0 standin for nothing and 1 stading for Steel Ingots)</sup>
<hr>
This mod have also a steel knife, a powerful a quite quick weapon that can be crafted with one stick and one steel ingot!<br>
And, as last crafts with steel, player can craft Steel Arrow (No special effect added by now) and steel tip (Wich is used instead of steel when crafting steel arrows) that you can get with a single steel ingot!
